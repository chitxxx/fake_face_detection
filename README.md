## Project title:

Detecting Fake Face Images using Neural network Models


## Summary:

This projects attempts to detect fake photoshopped human face pictures. The data is distributed by the Computational Intelligence and Photography Lab
at the Department of Computer Science of Yonsei University, South Korea. The dataset contains 960 fake faces and 1081 real faces. A sample of the fake faces is showed below:

Further, the fake element of each photo is marked by using binary 0/1 digits.

The objective of this project is to establish a neural network model that detect fake face images. The project will attempt to construct two models of different levels of detection. The basic model will determine whether an image is fake, the more advanced version will also detect which component is fake. 

Technically, the project will experiment with different types of convolutional neutral network to optimize model performance. With a relatively small dataset, various data augmentation strategies will be used to increase the number of training samples. Further, fake face images generated by GAN-based methods will potentially be used to enrich the dataset. Beyond, the design of loss function for the advanced model that detect fake components will reference loss function designs proposed in object detection applications.
